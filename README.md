Assignment 4 for CS441.

Screen 1 (MainActivity) displays a list of character names from the Game League of Legends, along with two SeekBars
to determine the value of M and B in the formula y = mx + b, to be used in the graph in screen 2 (Activity 2).
When the "go to graph" button is pressed, the values from the seekbar are doubled using a webservice. Then, these values 
are used to make the graph on screen 2.

Currently, there are some errors in sending and doubling the values over the web.
